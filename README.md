### Main Pages

- **index.html**: The homepage that displays the featured movies, along with a search bar and footer.
- **about.html**: An optional page about the website or platform.
- **search.html**: A page to display search results when a user looks for a specific movie.

## Usage

1. **Homepage**:
   - Displays a list of featured or popular movies.
   - Each movie is represented with a poster, title, release date, and rating.
   
2. **Search**:
   - A search bar at the top allows users to search for movies by title. You can implement an API for real-time search results.

3. **Movie Details**:
   - When a user clicks on a movie poster or title, they will be directed to a page (or modal) with detailed information about the movie, including its genre, release date, cast, and synopsis.

4. **Customization**:
   - Modify the `index.html`, `about.html`, or `search.html` files to add your own content.
   - Change the `style.css` file to adjust the design, colors, and layout to fit your needs.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: For creating the structure of the web pages.
- **CSS**: For styling and layout of the pages.
- **JavaScript**: For any dynamic behaviors, such as the search function.
- **Optional API**: Integrate with external movie APIs like [OMDb](http://www.omdbapi.com/) to fetch real-time movie data.

## How to Customize

1. **Change Text and Content**:
   - Modify the text in the HTML files to reflect your movie listings, descriptions, and other content.
   
2. **Add Movie Posters**:
   - Replace the images in the `assets/images/` folder with your own movie posters.

3. **Style Adjustments**:
   - Open `assets/css/style.css` and adjust the styles (e.g., colors, fonts, layout) to customize the look and feel of the website.

4. **Add More Pages**:
   - You can create new HTML pages for additional sections such as "Reviews," "News," or "Contact."

## Deployment

You can deploy the website on popular platforms like:

- **GitHub Pages**: Host static websites directly from your GitHub repository.
- **Netlify**: Deploy easily with drag-and-drop or via GitHub integration.
- **Vercel**: Similar to Netlify, an easy-to-use deployment platform.
